<p>I was quite sure that my next post would be about some programming stuff since I spent most of my free time with <i>RoR</i>, <i>Django</i> and <i>gamification</i> stuff lately. Anyhow&hellip; Here I find myself writing about my two latest discoveries <strong>in music</strong>.</p>

<p>That got me thinking, maybe I should start something like a <b>weekly music digest</b> where I can present to you all the little musical treasures I stumbled upon. Well, we&rsquo;ll see next week!</p>

<hr />

<p>But today I want to present you <b>Girl Talk</b>, an US-American mashup artist who mixes rap music with pop and rock songs of the last three decades. The result is an extraordinary blend which works <strong>pretty</strong> well as my daily motivation boost&mdash;thank god <i>Tracy Osborn</i> shared this <a href="http://www.limedaring.com/the-worst-enemy-to-my-startup-is-depression/">on her blog</a>.</p>

<p>And you don&rsquo;t even know the best part: You can go to <a href="http://illegal-art.net/girltalk/">Girl Talk&rsquo;s label page</a> and download his latest album and four more for free and pay-what-you-want respectively. That&rsquo;s a no-brainer!</p>

<p>Do you still need a little push? Okay, what about <i>Single Ladies</i> and <i>Ante Up</i> on one track? Yeah&hellip; I know! Go get the music, I&rsquo;ll be here when you come back.</p>

<p>A friend of mine shared this Youtube playlist on Facebook today and boy, what a <strong>revelation</strong> this is! Artists like Macklemore, Dessa, Fountains of Wayne, Pixies or Frank Turner paused their usual work life and visited <i>National Public Radio</i> for a short live concert in a cozy atmosphere.</p>

<p>Cancel all your appointments, make yourself a nice cup of this tea you like and enjoy:</p>
