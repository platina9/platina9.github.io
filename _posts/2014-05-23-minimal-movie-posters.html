<p>It&rsquo;s 3:37 am and I can&rsquo;t sleep so I thought I might dig up an old project of mine. May I present to you my first steps in <i>Inkscape</i> I took almost a year ago. As a huge fan of feel-good/coming-of-age movies as well as minimal design, I grabbed five of my favorite DVDs and turned key moments into posters.</p>
