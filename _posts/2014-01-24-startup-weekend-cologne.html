<p>I&rsquo;m just a few hours away from my first Startup Weekend experience. The concept is simple, yet highly contagious and addictive, apparently: A bunch of developers, designers and economists meet and team up to raise several startup companies. In <strong>54 hours</strong>!</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I did not have the time to come up with my own company draft in the last couple of weeks. So I won&rsquo;t participate in the so-called <i>pitch session</i> where people are given 60 seconds to advertise for their idea. But that&rsquo;s okay, this time I will just see how things are going and be part of a bunch of people who gathered for this single purpose&mdash;to <strong>build stuff</strong>.</p>

<p>Also, I&rsquo;m really excited for going back to Cologne. Every time I visit the city, I fall for her more and more. Hopefully, there will be a little bit of spare time to meet some friends and have an ice-cold <i>KÃ¶lsch</i><sup><a href="#fn1" id="r1">[1]</a>.</p>

<p>PS. The trip from Saarbr&uuml;cken&mdash;the city where I live&mdash;to Cologne is a four hour drive and I was lucky to stumble upon a wonderful song yesterday which happens to be my travelling tune for today. Enjoy!</p>

<p><time class="update" datetime="2014-02-05">Update Feb 05:</time> That weekend was amazing! I was part of an awesome team and, although <a href="http://cologne.startupweekend.org/2014/01/27/and-the-winner-is/">we did not win</a>, we are pressing ahead with our idea&mdash;come visit us at <del><a href="http://deepr.co">deepr.co</a></del> <ins><a href="http://godeepr.com">godeepr.com</a></ins>. I even had the chance to drink a few <i>K&ouml;lsch</i> both with my friend/host Obi and my fellow entrepreneurs (since the organizers of Startup Weekend Cologne provided us with an inexhaustible source of the afore-said beverage). On top of that, I met a lot of incredibly interesting people, learned a ton of stuff and got to know Cologne a little better. Comprehensive victory, I&rsquo;d say!</p>
